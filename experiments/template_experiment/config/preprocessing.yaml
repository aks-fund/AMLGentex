# Preprocessing Configuration
# Controls feature engineering from raw transaction data
#
# NOTE: Convention over configuration - paths are auto-discovered:
# - Experiment root: Auto-detected from config location (../../ from this file)
# - Raw data file: {experiment_root}/temporal/tx_log.parquet
# - Preprocessed data directory: {experiment_root}/preprocessed

# Paths auto-constructed based on experiment root (no need to specify)

# Time window aggregation for features
num_windows: 4
window_len: 25  # days

# Train/val/test splits (inductive learning - can overlap)
